Welcome to **Tooly** - a collection of AI-powered tool packages designed for seamless integration with the AI SDK, plus support for OpenAI function calling and Anthropic tool use.

## What is Tooly?

Tooly provides pre-built, type-safe packages that enable AI applications to interact with popular services like email providers and project management tools. Built specifically for the AI SDK, Tooly packages make it incredibly easy to add powerful functionality to your AI agents.

## Key Features

- **AI SDK First**: Built specifically for the AI SDK with first-class support
- **Multi-Framework**: Also works with OpenAI function calling and Anthropic tool use
- **Modular Packages**: Install only what you need
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with Zod validation
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup with consistent APIs

## Quick Start

Get started in seconds by installing a Tooly package:

```bash
npm install @tooly/resend
# or
npm install @tooly/linear
```

Then use it with the AI SDK:

```typescript
import { generateText } from 'ai'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { createAITools } from '@tooly/resend'

const tools = createAITools('your-resend-api-key')

// Use with AI SDK
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4.1-nano'),
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Send a welcome email' }],
  tools,
})
```
