Welcome to **Tooly** - a collection of AI-powered tool packages designed for seamless integration with OpenAI function calling, Anthropic tool use, and Vercel AI SDK.

## What is Tooly?

Tooly provides pre-built, type-safe packages that enable AI applications to interact with popular services like email providers and project management tools. Instead of building API integrations from scratch, you can use Tooly packages to add powerful functionality to your AI agents.

## Key Features

- **ðŸ¤– AI-First Design**: Built specifically for AI function calling and tool use
- **ðŸ“¦ Modular Packages**: Install only what you need
- **ðŸ”’ Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with Zod validation
- **ðŸ”§ Framework Agnostic**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Vercel AI SDK
- **âš¡ Easy Integration**: Simple setup with consistent APIs

## Quick Start

Get started in seconds by installing a Tooly package:

```bash
npm install @tooly/resend
# or
npm install @tooly/linear
```

Then use it with your preferred AI framework:

```typescript
import { createVercelAITools } from "@tooly/resend";

const tools = createVercelAITools("your-api-key");

// Use with Vercel AI SDK
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Send a welcome email" }],
  tools,
});
```

## Why Tooly?

### Before Tooly
```typescript
// Manual API integration
const response = await fetch('https://api.resend.com/emails', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}` },
  body: JSON.stringify(emailData)
});
// Handle errors, validation, AI integration...
```

### With Tooly
```typescript
// AI-ready tools
import { createOpenAIFunctions } from "@tooly/resend";

const { tools, executeFunction } = createOpenAIFunctions(apiKey);
// Ready for AI function calling!
```
