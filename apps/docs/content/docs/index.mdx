## Quick Start

Get started in seconds by installing a Tooly package:

```bash
npm install @tooly/resend
# or
npm install @tooly/linear
```

Then use it with the AI SDK:

```typescript
import { generateText } from 'ai'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { createAITools } from '@tooly/resend'

const tools = createAITools('your-resend-api-key')

// Use with AI SDK
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4.1-nano'),
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Send a welcome email' }],
  tools,
})
```
